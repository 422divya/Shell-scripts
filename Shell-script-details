==> If we run command below command what will be the output
$ date|echo "today is"

[dprabhu@dentestmgmtutil01 scripts]$ date | echo "today is"
today is

==> It only output the echo statement
==> date command sends the output to stdin so pipe command does not send the output of date command to the second command.
==> pipe does not receives the output from the default command
