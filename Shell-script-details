1- If we run command below command what will be the output
$ date|echo "today is"

[dprabhu@dentestmgmtutil01 scripts]$ date | echo "today is"
today is

==> It only output the echo statement
==> date command sends the output to stdin so pipe command does not send the output of date command to the second command.
==> pipe does not receives the output from the default command


2- awk -F" " '{print $1}'

==> -F" " sets the field separator to a space, so each line is split into fields wherever a space occurs.
==> '{print $1}' tells awk to print the first field ($1) from each line

3- set -e in shell script
==>It exists the script when there is error. But it will not error out when there is pipe. 
==> When we have pipe command used it will just check the last command.
Example  echo test| abc >> for this script will error out
echo test| abc |df -h >> for this script will not error out even when abc is not valid command. So when pipe is used it just checks the last command in pipe.

==> So for that we need to use below set -o pipefail

==> So whenever using "set -e" use "set -o pipeline"
